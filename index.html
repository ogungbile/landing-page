<div  class="rect1" id="about"><h2>About</h2> 
<br/><br/>
<p>I worked for an ISP(Internet Service Provider) and their customers were not pleased with the fact that they had to call the company’s support line before they could alter some changes that they consider simple and basic like changing the router’s Wi-Fi password which other ISP’s made available for their clients to do themselves.
In the past, the company did give them log in details to the universal router to effect changes, but most clients went beyond what they possess technical capability to handle and tamper with other settings which most times results in loss of internet connectivity, hence costing the company resources scheduling an engineer’s visit to evaluate the situation and rectify the issue.
In this regard, I have come up with customizing the control panel of the router by providing limited control to customers and make them do basic things themselves.
